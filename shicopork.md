## Overview

- ShicoPork Multiplayer is a cooperative multiplayer platformer game where players can collaborate to solve puzzles and progress through levels. This project leverages HTML5 Canvas, Node.js, and Socket.IO for real time communication between players.

## Features

- Multiplayer support with real-time player synchronization.
- Platformer mechanics including jumping, moving, and colliding with objects.
- Cooperative puzzles such as collecting coins, finding keys, and unlocking doors.
- Dynamic physics for player and object interactions.
- Customizable game levels with barriers, platforms, and interactive objects.

## Setup

To run ShicoPork Multiplayer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ReyGraph/shicopork.git
   cd ShicoPork-Multiplayer


## Install dependencies:

1. **Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required npm packages.**


- npm install

**Start the server:**

- npm start

## Open the game:

- Open your web browser and go to **http://localhost:3000** Ensure multiple browser windows or tabs are open to simulate multiple players.

## Usage

**Controls:**

- Arrow keys for movement (left, right, up).
Spacebar to attach/detach a rope (working on the Rope mechanics).
Move and interact with objects using physics-based mechanics.

**Objective:**

- Collaborate with other players to solve puzzles, collect coins, find keys, and unlock doors.

- Complete levels by achieving specific objectives or reaching designated areas.


# Gameplay 

- Communicate with other players using chat (if i will be implementing it)
Use platform mechanics to navigate challenging environments.
Pay attention to physics interactions to solve puzzles efficiently.
Main Points to Be Fixed
Collision Detection:

## Game Mechanics

- Enhance platformer mechanics such as jumping, moving, and interacting with objects.
Improve responsiveness and smoothness of player movements.
Puzzle Design:

- Create engaging cooperative puzzles that require strategic thinking and teamwork.
Test and refine puzzle elements to ensure they are challenging yet enjoyable.

## Short Note From The Developer

I'm only working on this an open source project, the game is not complete on this one version, I'm focusing on game mechanics rather than the gameplay for now, and so on there is not much in the game for now, i have tried to explain the game.js code by commenting on it, 


## To Be Fixed / Added

- Fix collision detection between players and movable objects.
- Improve physics simulation for smoother movement.
- Enhance visual feedback for player interactions.
- Implement additional game levels and puzzles.
- Optimize network synchronization for multiplayer experience.
- Music & SFX
- In-Game Map editor
- Game Levels 
- Ensure accurate collision detection between players, objects, and platforms.
- Fix any issues with overlapping or incorrect collision responses.
